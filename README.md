📄 Resume Relevance Check System
🚀 Problem Statement
Recruiters spend a lot of time scanning resumes to match them against job descriptions. Manual screening is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent.
Goal: Automate the resume screening process by extracting content from resumes (PDF/DOCX) and ranking them against job descriptions using NLP + ML techniques.


🧠 Approach
Data Ingestion
Upload resumes in .pdf / .docx format
Extract text using PyMuPDF & docx2txt
Preprocessing
Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
Keyword extraction from resumes & job description
Feature Engineering
TF-IDF vectorization
Cosine similarity for relevance scoring
ML Model (Scikit-learn)
Train relevance scoring pipeline
Rank resumes by similarity score
Streamlit Web App
Upload resumes + JD
Display results in a ranked table
Download structured report
